"""Vercel entrypoint.

Vercel's Python runtime looks for an ASGI-compatible callable named `app` in
files under /api and serves it directly -- no adapter (Mangum etc.) needed for
a plain FastAPI app. This file just re-exports the same app used locally, so
there is exactly one FastAPI application definition, not a Vercel-specific
fork of it.

vercel.json rewrites every path here; the app itself still owns routing
(/, /chat, /health, /debug/*), same as running `python target_agent/run_agent.py`
locally.
